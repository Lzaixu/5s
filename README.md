  <h1>5S Training with PDCA</h1>

  <p>**5S** is a methodology for organizing and improving your workplace for efficiency and effectiveness. It stands for five Japanese terms that translate to:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>**Sort (Seiri)**: Eliminate unnecessary items from the workplace.</li>
    <li>**Set in Order (Seiton)**: Arrange necessary items in a designated place for easy retrieval.</li>
    <li>**Shine (Seiso)**: Clean and inspect the workplace to identify and address issues.</li>
    <li>**Standardize (Seiketsu)**: Create visual standards for maintaining the organized workplace.</li>
    <li>**Sustain (Shitsuke)**: Continuously practice and improve 5S principles.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Act) cycle can be effectively integrated with 5S to create a continuous improvement process.</p>

    <p>
      * **Plan:** Designate specific storage locations for all necessary items. Consider frequency of use for placement.
